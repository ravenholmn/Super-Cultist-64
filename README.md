# Super Cultist 64 (Jam project)
This Super Mario 64 clone was made for 5th Annual Luisiana Texh University Game Jam in April 2023 under 
48 hours. Scripts used for the project were entirely created by me, except for a few packages used
for quality of life purposes while developing the game (such as a shortcut changer that unbinds all
Unity shortcuts on play) and the DoTween pack for simple animations.

All 3d modelling was done by [@safkannu](https://github.com/Safkannu)
