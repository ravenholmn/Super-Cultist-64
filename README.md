# LTUJam
# This Super Mario 64 clone was made for Annual Luisiana Texh University Game Jam in April 2023 under 
# 48 hours. Scripts used for the project were entirely created by me, except for a few packages used
# for quality of life purposes while developing the game (such as a shortcut changer that unbinds all
# Unity shortcuts on play) and the DoTween pack for simple animations.
